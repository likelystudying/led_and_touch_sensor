Two projects

1. led clock (clock.py)

  description: 
    -  the led strip works like a clock. 
    -  there are 60 leds on an led strip which represents the seconds, minutes and hours.
    -  runs on raspberry pi 3bp and wpi led strip rpi_ws281x

  features:
    - displays current hour, minute and second on an led strip
    - breathing animation for hour and minute leds
    - works with threads and asyncio. 

  hardware required:
    - rp3bp tested 
    - ws2812
    - 5v external source for the led strip to power 
    - 330 ohm in series with the data line to reduce ringing
    - capacitor not added but its recomended for smooth breathing

  how to run:
    - the led strip input pwm is connected to raspberry pi gpio
    - to execute 'sudo python3 abc.py' must be sudo for rpi_ws281x to work

2. Touch sensor game

description
  - reaction game for seniors. 
  - there are 4 touch sensors and each sensor has a led. if the led turns on the user touches and another led turns on.
  - runs on a raspberry pi 3bp and the led strip and mcp23017 and touch sensors
  - mcp23017 is used to reduce the number of gpio pin use on raspberry pi for touch sensors
features
hardware required
  - rb3bp 
  - ws2812
  - mcp23017
  - touch sensors
how to run 
  - to execute 'python3 LedStrip.py'
