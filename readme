Two projects

1. LED_CLOCK led clock (clock.py)

  description: 
    -  the led strip works like a clock. 
    -  there are 60 leds on an led strip which represents the seconds, minutes and hours.
    -  runs on raspberry pi 3bp and wpi led strip rpi_ws281x

  features:
    - displays current hour, minute and second on an led strip
    - breathing animation for hour and minute leds
    - works with threads and asyncio. 

  hardware required:
    - rp3bp tested 
    - ws2812
    - 5v external source for the led strip to power 
    - 330 ohm in series with the data line to reduce ringing
    - capacitor not added but its recomended for smooth breathing

  how to run:
    - the led strip input pwm is connected to raspberry pi gpio
    - to execute 'sudo python3 abc.py' must be sudo for rpi_ws281x to work

2. REACTION_GAME Touch sensor game

description
  - reaction game for seniors. 
  - there are 4 touch sensors and each sensor has a led. if the led turns on the user touches and another led turns on.
  - runs on a raspberry pi 3bp and the led strip and mcp23017 and touch sensors
  - mcp23017 is used to reduce the number of gpio pin use on raspberry pi for touch sensors
features
hardware required
  - rb3bp 
  - ws2812
  - mcp23017
  - touch sensors
how to run 
  - to execute 'python3 LedStrip.py'

3. REACTION_GAME_2 Touch sensor game

description
  - rp2040 zero, oled display and 4 touch sensors
  - the game represents math questions maps answers to touch sensors tracks the player's score and time
  - user provides questions.json which contains questions, answers and choices

features
  - displays math questions and answers on the oled screen
  - uses 4 capacitive touch sensors with mcp23017 i2c
  - player selects the correct answer
  - wrong answr adds a 3 sec penalty
  - questions, answers and choices loaded from a json file

hardware required
  - rp2040 zero
  - mcp23017 gpio expander i2c
  - ssd1306 oled display i2c
  - 4 touch sensors 
  - 4.7kohm pull up on sda and scl
  - wiring
